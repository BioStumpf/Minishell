//Word splitting only if outside ""/double quotes (for both redirs and commands)
//expandsion in general outside ''/single quotes only
//1. for redirections expand and check IFS, if any word splitting involved give back that redirection is ambigous (since there can not be 2 args to it) (note however IFS chars at beginning and end of character is allowed)
//2. for commands expand each word/argument, check if IFS present, if so crop them from beginning and end of the expanded variable, if IFS char in the middle of variable split the word
//3. tread $'' not as expansion but as normal single quotes
//4. tread $"" not as expansion but as a normal double quote
